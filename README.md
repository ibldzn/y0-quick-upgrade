# Yakuza 0 Quick Upgrade

What it does is pretty simple, when you're upgrading your legend style abilities instead of only upgrading
the particular node you choose it will instead upgrade every node on the legend style's abilities tree and then you'll immediately level up by 1.

In other words, upgrading one node == increasing one level of your legend style. Also, make sure you have enough money to upgrade every node!

## Installation

1. Install [RyuModManager](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/RyuModManager); [safe to skip if you already have it installed]
2. Download the .asi file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ibldzn/y0-quick-upgrade/releases/latest)
3. Move the .asi file into Yakuza 0 installation directory
4. Done!

## Protip

1. Use macro/script for your keyboard to acquire the skill for you
2. Use Speedhack feature on Cheat Engine and move the slider all the way to the right, so it goes even faster; [[screenshot]](https://i.imgur.com/hBiXJI8.png)
3. You can also "freeze" your money with Cheat Engine so you can leave your game be while the macro/script you set up is doing the job for you
4. You probably don't want to upgrade too much. Being so strong will make the fights pretty boring.

## Known Issue (probably won't be fixed)

- The mod will upgrade every node in your legend style's abilities tree, including the one you already bought,
  so if you don't want a single yen goes to waste make sure you're in a "fresh tree" which doesn't have anything upgraded (any level is okay though).

- It will also ignore the "Locked" part of your legend style's abilities tree (as you can see in the screenshot above), not sure if the upgrade actually affect your stats, just to be safe make sure don't have "Locked" nodes like in the screenshot
